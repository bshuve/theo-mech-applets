            <h2>The Brachistochrone Problem</h2>
            <p>The brachistochrone problem, posed by Johann Bernoulli in 1696, asks: <em>"What is the curve of fastest descent between two points for a bead sliding under gravity?"</em></p>
            
            <div class="math-box">
                <p>The solution is a <strong>cycloid</strong> - the curve traced by a point on the rim of a rolling circle. Mathematically, it minimizes the functional:</p>
                <p>\[ T = \int_{A}^{B} \frac{\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}}{\sqrt{2g(y_A - y)}} \, dx \]</p>
                <p>where \(T\) is the travel time, \(g\) is gravity, and \(y_A\) is the starting height.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>The Principle of Least Action</h2>
            <p>This fundamental principle states that the path taken by a physical system between two states is the one for which the <em>action</em> is minimized:</p>
            
            <div class="math-box">
                <p>\[ S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} (T - U) \, dt \]</p>
                <p>where \(T\) is kinetic energy and \(U\) is potential energy. For the brachistochrone, we minimize time rather than action, but the mathematical principles are similar.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>In this applet, you can draw paths between two points and see how closely they approximate the true brachistochrone curve based on the travel time and energy conservation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="theory">
            <h2>How to Use This Applet</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Draw a path</strong> between the pink starting point (top-left) and pink ending point (bottom-right)</li>
                <li>Observe the <strong>travel time</strong> calculation in the stats panel</li>
                <li>Examine the <strong>energy graphs</strong> to see if energy is conserved</li>
                <li>Compare different paths to see which is fastest</li>
                <li>Try to draw the theoretical solution - a cycloid curve</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="math-box">
                <h3>Key Physics Concepts</h3>
                <p><strong>Kinetic Energy:</strong> \[ T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]</p>
                <p><strong>Potential Energy:</strong> \[ U = mgh \]</p>
                <p><strong>Conservation of Energy:</strong> \[ T + U = \text{constant} \]</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The true brachistochrone path will show a smooth conversion of potential to kinetic energy with minimal fluctuations in total energy.</p>
