    <h1>Understanding the Cycloids </h1>
    <h2>🔁 Recap from the Previous Page </h2>
    <p>
        On the previous page, we explore different Bézier curves connecting points A and B under the influence of gravity.
        We learnt that the optimal solution, the path with least time, is not a straight line — it’s a special curve called the <strong>cycloid</strong>. 
        But what exactly is a cycloid? Let's dive in.
    </p>
    <!-- Brachistochrone Problem Explanation -->
    <h2>🌀 The Brachistochrone Problem</h2>
    <p>
        The Brachistochrone problem is a famous challenge in physics and mathematics:
        <q>What curve provides the shortest travel time for a particle sliding under gravity between two points at different heights, not directly below each other?</q>
        Interestingly, the solution to this problem is the <span class="tooltip" title="A curve formed by a point on a rolling circle">cycloid</span>—the same curve traced by a point on a rolling wheel.
    </p>
   
    

    <!-- Explanation of the Cycloid Curve -->
    <h2>What is a Cycloid?</h2>
    <p>
        A cycloid is a curve generated by a point on the circumference of a circle as the circle rolls along a straight line without slipping. 
        The animation below shows a rotating point on a circle. The cycloid wheel has a single radius line segment drawn. 
        This radius also rotates as the wheel rotates.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we plot the curve traced by the point on the circle, the trajectory is shown in the following animation.

    <p>As the wheel rotates, it also moves along in space.</p>

    </div>
    <figcaption>Figure 3: Cycloid wheel rotating and moving along in space.</figcaption>
    
    <p>
        The cycloid curve is traced by a point on the rim of the wheel as it moves along a path.
        This point on the rim is the point at which the radius intersects the wheel.

    <!-- Mathematical Representation -->
    <h2>Mathematical Representation</h2>
    <p>The parametric equations for a cycloid are:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        x(t) = r(t - sin(t)), &nbsp; y(t) = r(1 - cos(t))
    </div>
    <p>
        Here, <i>r</i> is the radius of the circle, and <i>t</i> is the rotation angle in radians. These equations define the path traced by a point on the circle as it rolls along the ground.
    </p>


    <h2>🧠 Questions for Deeper Thinking</h2>

    <div class="question-card">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why does the cycloid produce the fastest descent time, even though it may look longer than the straight line?</p>
        <button class="button" onclick="toggleSolution('solution1')">Show Solution for Question 1</button>
        <div id="solution1" class="solution-card" style="display: none;">
            <strong>Solution 1: </strong> Although the cycloid path is longer than the straight line, it allows the particle to drop more steeply at the beginning. This means it gains speed more quickly due to gravity.
            Once the particle gains speed, it travels the remaining distance distance faster.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> If the initial segment of the cycloid is very steep, doesn't that make the total path longer? Why doesn't that matter?</p>
        <button class="button" onclick="toggleSolution('solution2')">Show Solution for Question 2</button>
        <div id="solution2" class="solution-card" style="display: none;">
            <strong>Solution 2: </strong> Although the path might be longer, it allows the object to gains speed, so the overall time is shorter. 
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> How does the particle’s speed vary along the cycloid? Where is it fastest and why?</p>
        <button class="button" onclick="toggleSolution('solution3')">Show Solution for Question 2</button>
        <div id="solution3" class="solution-card" style="display: none;">
            <strong>Solution 3: </strong> The particle starts from rest at the top of the cycloid and gains speed as it descends, due to gravitational acceleration. 
            Its speed increases with depth — it’s fastest at the lowest point of the curve. This happens because the kinetic energy increases as potential energy is lost. 
            The cycloid allows the particle to gain that speed more efficiently by using a steep initial slope.
        </div>
    </div>

    

    <div class="question-card">
        <strong>Challenge:</strong> Can you derive the time it takes for a particle to slide down the cycloid using energy conservation and calculus?
    </div>


    

   
    


    <h2>📎 Optional Extension</h2>
    <p>
        The cycloid is not only the solution to the brachistochrone problem — it's also the solution to the <strong>tautochrone problem</strong>, where all particles, regardless of starting point on the curve, reach the bottom at the same time.
