    <h1>Understanding the Cycloid</h1>

    <h2>üîÅ Recap from the Previous Page</h2>
    <p>
        On the previous page, you explored different B√©zier curves connecting two points under gravity and discovered that one curve gave the shortest travel time.
        You also learned that the optimal solution is not a straight line ‚Äî it‚Äôs a special curve called the <strong>cycloid</strong>. But what exactly is a cycloid? Let's dive in.
    </p>

    <h2>üåÄ What is the Brachistochrone Curve?</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Brachistochrone Problem</strong> asks:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        What is the shape of the curve down which a particle will slide from one point to another (under gravity and without friction) in the least time?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The answer, surprisingly, is a <strong>cycloid</strong> ‚Äî the path traced by a point on the rim of a wheel as it rolls along a straight line. This solution was first proposed by Johann Bernoulli in 1696 and led to the development of the calculus of variations.
    </p>

    <h2>üîÑ Visualizing a Cycloid</h2>
    <p>
        Let‚Äôs see what a cycloid looks like. The animation below shows a circle rolling along a flat surface with a point on its rim tracing the curve.
    </p>

    <div class="sketch-container">
        <div id="sketch0-cycloid-only"></div>
        <figcaption>Figure 1: Cycloid wheel with a rotating radius line.</figcaption>
    </div>

    <p>
        As the wheel rotates, the point moves up and down while also moving forward ‚Äî this creates the familiar arch-like cycloid shape.
    </p>

    <div class="sketch-container">
        <div id="sketch0-cycloid-on-circle"></div>
        <figcaption>Figure 2: Cycloid wheel rolling along a straight line.</figcaption>
    </div>

    <div class="sketch-container">
        <div id="sketch1-cycloid-moving"></div>
        <figcaption>Figure 3: The wheel in motion ‚Äî tracing a cycloid.</figcaption>
    </div>

    <div class="sketch-container">
        <div id="sketch2-cycloid-path"></div>
        <figcaption>Figure 4: The cycloid path traced by the point on the rim.</figcaption>
    </div>

    <h2>üìê Mathematical Representation</h2>
    <p>The parametric equations of a cycloid are:</p>
    <div class="equation" style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        \[
        x(t) = r(t - \sin t), \quad y(t) = r(1 - \cos t)
        \]
    </div>
    <p>
        Here, \( r \) is the radius of the rolling circle, and \( t \) is the angle of rotation (in radians).
        As \( t \) increases, the point traces out the cycloid horizontally along the x-axis.
    </p>

    <h2>üß† Questions for Deeper Thinking</h2>

    <div class="question-card">
        <strong>Question 1:</strong> Why does the cycloid produce the fastest descent time, even though it may look longer than the straight line?
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <strong>Question 2:</strong> If the initial segment of the cycloid is very steep, doesn't that make the total path longer? Why doesn't that matter?
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <strong>Question 3:</strong> How does the particle‚Äôs speed vary along the cycloid? Where is it fastest and why?
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <strong>Challenge:</strong> Can you derive the time it takes for a particle to slide down the cycloid using energy conservation and calculus?
    </div>

    <h2>üìé Optional Extension</h2>
    <p>
        The cycloid is not only the solution to the brachistochrone problem ‚Äî it's also the solution to the <strong>tautochrone problem</strong>, where all particles, regardless of starting point on the curve, reach the bottom at the same time.
