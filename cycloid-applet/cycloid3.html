    <h1>Understanding the Cycloids </h1>
    <h2> Recap from the Previous Page </h2>
    <p>
        On the previous page, we explore different Bézier curves connecting points A and B under the influence of gravity.
        We learnt that the optimal solution, the path with least time, is not a straight line — it’s a special curve called the <strong>cycloid</strong>. 
        But what exactly is a cycloid? 
    </p>

    <!-- Explanation of the Cycloid Curve -->
    <h2>What is a Cycloid?</h2>
    <p>
        A cycloid is a curve generated by a point on the circumference of a circle as the circle rolls along a straight line without slipping. 
        The animation below shows a rotating point on a circle. The cycloid wheel has a single radius line segment drawn. 
        This radius also rotates as the wheel rotates.
    </p>

    <!-- Interactive Sketches -->

    <p>
        If we plot the curve traced by the point on the circle, the trajectory is shown in the following animation.

        Figure 2: Visualization of the cycloid trajectory. he green curve shows the path traced by the point on the wheel's rim as it rolls.
        Each arc corresponds to a full rotation of the wheel, with cusps forming when the point contacts the ground.

    </div>
    

    <p>As the wheel rotates, it also moves along in space.</p>

    <p>
        The cycloid curve is traced by a point on the rim of the wheel as it moves along a path.
        This point on the rim is the point at which the radius intersects the wheel.

    <!-- Mathematical Representation -->
    <h2>Mathematical Representation</h2>
    <p>The parametric equations for a cycloid are: </p>
        \[ x(t) = r(t - \sin t), \quad y(t) = r(1 - \cos t) \]
    
        where \(r\) is the radius of the circle, and <i>t</i> is the rotation angle in radians. These equations define the path traced by a point on the circle as it rolls along the ground.
        The cycloid's optimality comes from Fermat's principle of least time. Using calculus of variations, we can show that:
        <div class="equation">
            \[
            \frac{dy}{dx} = \sqrt{\frac{a - y}{y}}
            \]
        </div>
        where \( a \) is a constant. This differential equation is satisfied by the cycloid, proving it provides the path of least time.
        The steep initial descent allows rapid acceleration, while the flatter later section maintains high speed.
        
        </p>

    <h2> Questions for Deeper Thinking</h2>

    <div class="question-card">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why does the cycloid produce the fastest descent time, even though it may look longer than the straight line?</p>
        <button class="button" onclick="toggleSolution('solution1')">Show Solution for Question 1</button>
        <div id="solution1" class="solution-card" style="display: none;">
            <strong>Solution 1: </strong> Although the cycloid path is longer than the straight line, it allows the particle to drop more steeply at the beginning. This means it gains speed more quickly due to gravity.
            Once the particle gains speed, it travels the remaining distance distance faster.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> If the initial segment of the cycloid is very steep, doesn't that make the total path longer? Why doesn't that matter?</p>
        <button class="button" onclick="toggleSolution('solution2')">Show Solution for Question 2</button>
        <div id="solution2" class="solution-card" style="display: none;">
            <strong>Solution 2: </strong> Although the path might be longer, it allows the object to gains speed, so the overall time is shorter. 
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> How does the particle’s speed vary along the cycloid? Where is it fastest and why?</p>
        <button class="button" onclick="toggleSolution('solution3')">Show Solution for Question 2</button>
        <div id="solution3" class="solution-card" style="display: none;">
            <strong>Solution 3: </strong> The particle starts from rest at the top of the cycloid and gains speed as it descends, due to gravitational acceleration. 
            Its speed increases with depth — it’s fastest at the lowest point of the curve. This happens because the kinetic energy increases as potential energy is lost. 
            The cycloid allows the particle to gain that speed more efficiently by using a steep initial slope.
        </div>
    </div>

    

    <div class="question-card">
        <strong>Challenge:</strong> Can you derive the time it takes for a particle to slide down the cycloid using energy conservation and calculus?
    </div>


    

    <h2> Optional Extension</h2>
    <p>
        The cycloid is not only the solution to the brachistochrone problem — it's also the solution to the <strong>tautochrone problem</strong>.
        A tautochrone is the curve for which the time taken by an object sliding without friction in uniform gravity to its lowest point is 
        independent of its starting point on the curve. Interesting, the curve is a cycloid.
