    <p class="text">
    Along with a visualization of the particle's motion along a specified path, we now show various quantities 
    (such as the kinetic and potential energies, and their derivatives) as functions of time. We also show the 
    <b>integral</b> of several of these quantities over the entire path, plotted as a function of \(p\), the 
    parameter used to specify the path. The checkboxes allow you to choose which of these integrated quantities 
    to plot. Recall that the alternative path is parametrized by the function \(y(t) = (1+p)(y_i-\frac{1}{2}gt^2)\).

        <b>Question 5:</b> As best you can, and in your own words, explain why the classical path minimizes the 
        action defined as the time integral of the kinetic minus potential energies over the path. Choosing two 
        paths, one with \(p<0\) and another with \(p>0\), explain for each why the action is larger than the minimal

        <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
        The integral balances kinetic and potential energy over the path, ensuring minimal deviation from equilibrium conditions.
        <ul>
            <li>
                For paths with \( p < 0 \): The particle remains closer to the ground, causing the potential energy \( U \) 
                to decrease, but the kinetic energy is not optimized. The action increases due to this imbalance.
            </li>
            <li>
                For paths with \( p > 0 \): The particle travels higher than the classical path, increasing both 
                potential and kinetic energy, which, again, leads to higher action values.
            </li>
            <li>
                The classical path (when \( p = 0 \)) is the most “efficient” path where energy trade-offs between \( T \) 
                and \( U \) are balanced, leading to the smallest value of the action.
                While “action” might still seem abstract, the simulation provides some intuitions. The action is analogous 
                to a “best score.” Think of the classical path as achieving the most optimal motion based on physics, where 
                energy is neither wasted nor underutilized.
