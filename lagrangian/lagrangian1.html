    Consider an object of mass \(m\) constrained to move with constant velocity \(\dot{x}\) in the \(x\) direction and experiencing uniform gravitational acceleration \(\ddot{y}\ = -g\) in the \(y\) direction. The object is launched from height \(h\) so that it experiences projectile motion with no initial \(y\) velocity. The kinetic energy of the object (ignoring the constant from motion in the \(x\) direction) is \(T = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{y}^2\) and the potential energy is \(U=mgy\). We consider the path of the object, with its position beginning at \(y=h\) and ending when it lands on the ground at \(y=0\). <br>
    <br><br>
    The classical path in Cartesian coordinates is \(y(t) = -\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + h\). However, the action is invariant under coordinate transformations and one of the benefits of the Lagrangian approach is that we can readily change coordinates.  We therefore consider an alternate non-Cartesian coordinate \(w\), where \(w(y) = y^2\).

    \(y\) can take on any real value, whereas \(w\ge0\). Therefore \(w\) unambiguously gives the same path as \(y\) for \(y\ge0\).

    <b>Question 2: </b> Transform the kinetic and potential energies to the \(w\) coordinate, and derive the Euler-Lagrange equation for \(w\). Then, consider the particular classical solution \(y(t) = 1 - t^2\) (with \(h = 1\) and \(g = 2\)). Find \(w(t)\) for this path, and then by explicit substitution, verify that it satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation, \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{w}})\).

    We know that \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{w}})\) and that \(L = T - U\).<br>
    So we know that \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial T}{\partial w} - \frac{\partial U}{\partial w}\) and \(\frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{w}}) = \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{w}} - \frac{\partial U}{\partial \dot{w}})\).<br>
    \(T = \frac{1}{2}m(\frac{\dot{w}}{2 \sqrt{w}})^2\) since \(\dot{y} = \frac{\dot{w}}{2 \sqrt{w}}\) and \(U = 2m\sqrt{w}\) since \(y = \sqrt{w}\) and \(g = 2\).<br>
    Substituting in, we get:<br>
    \(\frac{\partial}{\partial w}(\frac{1}{2}m\frac{\dot{w}^2}{4w}) - \frac{\partial}{\partial w}(2m \sqrt{w}) = \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{w}}(\frac{1}{2}m \frac{\dot{w}^2}{4w}) - \frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{w}}(2m \sqrt{w}))\)<br>
    Which simplifies into:<br>
    \(-\frac{1}{2}\dot{w}^2 - 4w^{3/2} = \ddot{w}w - \dot{w}^2\)<br>
    <br>Recall that for the \(w\) parameterizations, the following apply: <br>
    \(w = y^2 = 1 - 2t^2 + t^4\)<br>
    \(\dot{w} = 2y\dot{y} = -4t + 4t^3\)<br>
    \(\ddot{w} = 2(\dot{y}^2 + y\ddot{y}) = -4 + 12t^2\)<br>
    <br>When we plug these into the equation above, we get the left-hand side of the equation as \(-\frac{1}{2}(-4t + 4t^3)^2 - 4(1-2t^2 + t^4)^{3/2}\), which simplifies to \(-4t^6 + 4t^4 + 4t^2 -4\).<br>
    The right-hand side is \((-4 + 12t^2)(1 - 2t^2 + t^4) - (-4t + 4t^3)^2\) and simplifies to \(-4t^6 + 4t^4 + 4t^2 -4\).<br>
    Thus, we have proven that both sides are equivalent, and that the Euler-Lagrange equation applies for a classical path in two different coordinate parameterizations!<br>

    You may have noticed that the parameterization of each side of the Euler-Lagrange equation looks different across different coordinate systems.
    That is, the graph for \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\) differs from \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial w}\), and \(\frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{y}})\) differs from \(\frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{w}})\).<br>
    However, \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{y}})\) and \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{w}})\),
    showing that no matter the choice of \(y\) or \(w\) as coordinates, the Euler-Lagrange equation still holds. These graphs provide a graphical demonstration for the mathematical explanation above.<br>
    In fact, you will find that the Euler-Lagrange equation can be generalized to any arbitrary coordinate system!

    <b>Question 4: </b>Recall the Euler-Lagrange equation in the \(w\) coordinate system as \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{w}})\).

    It's important to consider that because \(L=T-U\), \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = \frac{\partial T}{\partial q} - \frac{\partial U}{\partial q}\) and \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} = \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}} - \frac{\partial U}{\partial \dot{q}}\) for a generalized coordinate \(q\).
    Also recall that, when taking partial derivatives, \(\dot{q}\) is considered independent of \(q\).<br>
    In the \(y\) parameterization, \(T\) depends on \(\dot{y}\) but not \(y\).
    Thus, \(\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} = 0\), so \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = - \frac{\partial U}{\partial y} = -F_y\).
    In the same way, \(U\) depends on \(y\) but not \(\dot{y} \implies 
    \frac{\partial U}{\partial \dot{y}} = 0\), so \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{y}} = \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{y}}\). If we wanted to, we could just graph \(-\frac{\partial U}{\partial w}\) and \(\frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{w}})\),
    and the graphs should be equal according to the Euler-Lagrange equation.<br><br>
    In the \(w\) parameterization, \(U\) is independent of \(\dot w\), so we still have \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{w}} = \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{w}}\). However, \(T\) now has dependence on both \(w\) and \(\dot{w}\), so \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial w}\) has a kinetic energy term and a potential energy term.
    We must graph \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial w}\) and \(\frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{w}})\) to get equal quantities according to the Euler-Lagrange equation.<br><br>
    In general, kinetic terms for non-Cartesian coordinates can depend on both coordinates and velocities, and so it's important to pay attention to the dependencies of each term in the Euler-Lagrange equation on each generalized coordinate and velocity.
