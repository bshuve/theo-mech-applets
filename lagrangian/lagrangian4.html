    <h2 id="subtitle">Graphing the Lagrangian with respect to different quantities</h2>
    <p id="text">
        We return to the case of projectile motion starting from a height \(h\) above the ground as in Page 1. We only
        consider classical trajectories. We wish to explore how various quantities such as energies change between the
        two parametrizations of the path, one in terms of \(y\) and the other in terms of \(w = y^2\).
        <br><br>
        The height is parametrized in Cartesian coordinates by \(y(t) = -\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + h\). We can also parameterize
        this path using the \(w\) generalized coordinate system.

        <b>Question 6: </b> Consider the position of the object at time \(t\). Is the <i>physical</i> position of the
        object the same in both coordinate system? Is the value of the coordinate at time \(t\) the same in both
        coordinate systems?

        Where the particle is in space should not depend on how we parametrize the curve, so the physical position is
        the same in both cases. However, the value of the coordinate can be different at time \(t\): at time \(t\),
        \(y(t)=-\frac{1}{2}gt^2+h\) whereas \(w(t)=\left(-\frac{1}{2}gt^2+h\right)^2\). These are not equal unless
        \(w=y=0\). We can see this because they have different units (\(y\) is in \(\mathrm{m}\) and \(w\) is in
        \(\mathrm{m}^2\)) and so cannot be equal unless both are zero.

    <label for="show-q2" id="text">
        <b>Question 7: </b> Consider first the potential and kinetic energies written in terms of the coordinates \(y\)
        and \(w\), respectively. Do these energies have the same form when written in different coordinate systems? Now,
        consider potential and kinetic energies as functions of time along the classical trajectory. Are \(U(t)\) and
        \(T(t)\) the same in both coordinate systems?
        <br><br>
    </label>

    <span id="answer2" style="display: none"><br>

        In Cartesian coordinates, the kinetic energy is \(T=\frac{1}{2}m\dot y^2\) and the potential energy is
        \(U=mgy\). In the generalized coordinate, we have instead \(T=\frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{\dot w}{2\sqrt
        w}\right)^2\) and \(U=mg\sqrt w\). It is evident that the functional forms of the energies are different in
        different coordinate systems. <br><br>

        However, at a time \(t\) the point on the classical path is the same regardless of coordinate system, and
        consequently the energies are the same as well (since energies are scalars). Therefore, if we plot the kinetic
        and potential energies as functions of <i>time</i>, we should get the same answer regardless of which coordinate
        system we use for the intermediate steps.
    </span>

    <p id="text">
        Below, we have plotted potential energy and kinetic energy in two ways. On the left, we have used Cartesian
        coordinates; on the right, we have used the generalized coordinate \(w=y^2\). Because the coordinate \(y\) can
        take on either sign while \(w\) is always positive, we have taken the absolute value of the energies in
        Cartesian coordinates to facilitate a direct comparison. For energies that depend simultaneously on both
        position and velocity (for example, \(T\) depends on both \(w\) and \(\dot w\) in the generalized coordinate),
        we have evaluated the quantities along the classical trajectory to allow us to plot the energy as a function of
        only one variable at a time.
