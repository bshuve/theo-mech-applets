    <h1 id="title">Conserved Quantities: Energy and Angular Momentum Control</h1>

    <p id="text">
        <i>In this applet, we take direct control of the two fundamental conserved quantities in orbital mechanics:
            total energy (E) and angular momentum (L). </i>
    </p>

     <p id="text">
        In classical mechanics, the motion of two gravitationally interacting bodies—like the Earth and the Sun—can be
        complex. To simplify this, we can reframe it as an equivalent one-body problem using the
        concept of <strong>reduced mass</strong>, denoted by the symbol μ (mu), where:
        \[
        \mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
        \]
    </p>

    <p id="text">
        We can get the shape of the orbital path of μ as a function of the angle θ as follows:
        \[
        r(\theta) = \frac{L^2}{\mu G m_1 m_2}\frac{1}{1 + \epsilon \cos \theta}
        \]
        Here, \(\epsilon\) is the <strong>orbital eccentricity</strong>, a parameter that defines the orbit's shape.

            <p id="text">
                The total energy \(E\) of the system is also useful to understanding the behavior of the orbit. This
                energy
                is composed of three parts:
                \[
                E = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \mu \dot{r}^2}_{\text{Radial Kinetic Energy}} + \underbrace{\frac{L^2}{2\mu
                r^2}}_{\text{Angular Kinetic Energy}} - \underbrace{\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r}}_{\text{Gravitational Potential Energy}}
                \]
                The <strong>Radial Kinetic Energy</strong> is the energy of motion directly towards or away from the
                center of mass. The
                <strong>Angular Kinetic Energy</strong> is the energy of the orbital motion. Notice how this term has a
                dependence on \(r\) and not \(\dot r\). As r gets close to 0, there is an increasing outward force,
                preventing the orbit from getting too close to the center of mass. This is known as the centrifugal
                barrier.
            </p>

            <p id="text">
                Notice how the angular kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy both have a dependency on
                \(r\). These last two terms are often combined into an <strong>Effective Potential</strong>
                (\(U_{\text{eff}}\)), which we use to understand the shape of the trajectory:
                \[
                U_{\text{eff}}(r) = \frac{L^2}{2 \mu r^2} -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r}
                \]

                This applet models a star-planet system where the star's mass (\(m_1\)) is much greater than the
                planet's (\(m_2\)),
                similar to our Sun and Earth.

                    <b>Question:</b> In a system like the Sun and Earth where \(m_1 \gg m_2\), what does the reduced
                    mass \(\mu\) approximate to? What does this imply about the motion of the two bodies?

                    When \(m_1 \gg m_2\), the denominator \(m_1 + m_2\) is approximately equal to \(m_1\). So, \(\mu
                    \approx
                    \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1}\), which simplifies to \( \mu \approx m_2\). This means the reduced mass is
                    nearly
                    identical to the planet's mass. As a result, the motion will follow the Earth around the center of
                    mass, which will be mostly the Sun.

        We examine the most fundamental
        approach: directly setting the <strong>conserved quantities</strong> of the system. In orbital mechanics, energy
        and angular momentum are conserved throughout the motion, meaning they remain constant as the planet orbits.
        These two quantities completely determine the orbital characteristics.
    </p>

            <p id="text">
                The <strong>angular momentum L</strong> represents the "amount of rotation" in the system. It directly
                influences the orbital size and prevents the orbiting body from spiraling into the central mass -thanks
                to the centrifugal barrier.
            </p>

            <p id="text">
                What makes this approach powerful is that E and L completely determine the orbital parameters. Once you
                set these conserved quantities, the minimum radius and eccentricity are calculated as follows:
                \[
                r_{\text{min}} = \frac{-G m_1 m_2 + \sqrt{(G m_1 m_2)^2 + 2EL^2/\mu}}{2E}
                \]
                \[
                \epsilon = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2EL^2}{\mu(G m_1 m_2)^2}}
                \]

                    <b>Question:</b> What happens to r_min when you make the total energy less negative (closer to zero)
                    while keeping angular momentum constant? Why does this occur physically?

                    When E becomes less negative (approaches zero), the r_min decreases. This occurs because less
                    negative energy means the system is less tightly bound. The
                    planet can travel farther from the star before gravity pulls it back, creating a more stretched
                    ellipse and decreasing r_min.

                <li><strong>Eccentricity:</strong> Watch how making energy less negative (closer to zero) increases
                    eccentricity, stretching the orbit.</li>
                <li><strong>Angular Momentum Effects:</strong> See how higher L values create larger orbits and lower
                    eccentricities at the same energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Effective Potential Shape:</strong> Watch how changing E and L shapes the effective
