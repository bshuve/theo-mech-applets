    <h1 id="title">Orbital Motion and the Principle of Least Action</h1>

    <p id="text">
        <i>This applet visualizes the motion of a planet orbiting a star, demonstrating the physical principles that
            govern its trajectory. By adjusting key orbital parameters, you can explore how energy and angular momentum
            shape the path of a celestial body.</i>

    <p id="text">
        In classical mechanics, the motion of two gravitationally interacting bodies—like the Earth and the Sun—can be
        complex. To simplify this, we can reframe it as an equivalent one-body problem. This is achieved using the
        concept of <strong>reduced mass</strong>, denoted by the symbol μ (mu), where:
        
        \[ \mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \]

        This allows us to describe the motion of one body relative to the other in a much simpler way.
    </p>

    <p id="text">
        We can get the shape of the orbital path of μ as a function of the angle θ as follows:
        
        \[ r(\theta) = \frac{L^2}{\mu G m_1 m_2}\frac{1}{1 + \epsilon \cos \theta} \]

        Here, \(\epsilon\) is the <strong>orbital eccentricity</strong>, a parameter that defines the orbit's shape.
        When \(\epsilon < 1\), the path is a bound, elliptical orbit. While \(r(\theta)\) describes the path of the
            reduced mass, the actual paths of the two individual bodies are given by: \[
            r_{1}(\theta)=\frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2}r(\theta) \quad \text{and} \quad
            r_{2}(\theta)=-\frac{m_1}{m_1+m_2}r(\theta) \] 
    </p>

    <p id="text">
        The total energy \(E\) of the system is also useful to understanding the behavior of the orbit. This
        energy
        is composed of three parts:
        \[
        E = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \mu \dot{r}^2}_{\text{Radial Kinetic Energy}} + \underbrace{\frac{L^2}{2\mu
        r^2}}_{\text{Angular Kinetic Energy}} - \underbrace{\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r}}_{\text{Gravitational Potential
        Energy}}
        \]
        The <strong>Radial Kinetic Energy</strong> is the energy of motion directly towards or away from the
        center of mass. The
        <strong>Angular Kinetic Energy</strong> is the energy of the orbital motion. Notice how this term has a
        dependence on \(r\) and not \(\dot r\). As r gets close to 0, there is an increasing outward force,
        preventing the orbit from getting too close to the center of mass. This is known as the centrifugal
        barrier.
    </p>

    <p id="text">
        Notice how the angular kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy both have a dependency on
        \(r\). These last two terms are often combined into an <strong>Effective Potential</strong>
        (\(U_{\text{eff}}\)), which we use to understand the shape of the trajectory:
        \[
        U_{\text{eff}}(r) = \frac{L^2}{2 \mu r^2} -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r}
        \]

        This applet models a star-planet system where the star's mass (\(m_1\)) is much greater than the
        planet's (\(m_2\)),
        similar to our Sun and Earth.

            <strong>Question:</strong> In a system like the Sun and Earth where \(m_1 \gg m_2\), what does the reduced mass \(\mu\) approximate to? What does this imply about the motion of the two bodies?
        </div>
        <button id="show-q1" class="toggle-answer">Show answer</button>
        <div id="answer1" class="answer-text" style="display: none;">
            When \(m_1 \gg m_2\), the denominator \(m_1 + m_2\) is approximately equal to \(m_1\). So, \(\mu \approx \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1}\), which simplifies to \( \mu \approx m_2\). This means the reduced mass is nearly identical to the planet's mass. As a result, the motion will follow the Earth around the center of mass, which will be mostly the Sun.

        Use the sliders below to see how angular momentum and eccentricity affects the orbit. As you adjust the
        parameters, observe the changes in
        the three graphs. Pay attention to the radius of the planet from the sun and how this relates to the
        effective potential and kinetic energies.
