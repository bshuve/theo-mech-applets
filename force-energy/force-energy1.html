    Consider an object of mass \(m\) constrained to move with constant velocity \(\dot{x}\) in the \(x\) direction and experiencing uniform gravitational acceleration \(\ddot{y}\ = -g\) in the \(y\) direction. The object is launched from height \(h\) so that it experiences projectile motion with no initial \(\dot{y}\) velocity. The kinetic energy of the object is \(T = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{y}^2\) and the potential energy is \(U=mgy\). We consider the path of the object, with its position beginning at \(y=h\) and ending when it lands on the ground at \(y=0\). <br>

    <b>Question 2: </b>As you manipulated the sliders to change the force, how do the values of \(\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\) and \(\frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{y}})\) change? Is there a correlation between them?

<span id="answer2" style="display: none; line-height: 1.8">
    The Potential Derivative \((\frac{\partial U}{\partial y})\) vs. Time (s) graph shows the values of \(\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\) and \(-\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\). Because the force on the object is conservative, we know \(-\frac{\partial U}{\partial y} = F_y\). 
    If you compare your force calculation from using the sliders, it should match the value of the negative potential energy derivative on the graph. Note that the potential energy derivatives are time-independent because they are derived with respect to \(y\) position.
    Through the Kinetic Energy (kJ) vs. \(\dot{y}\) (m/s) graph, we can see that the relationship between \(T\) and \(\dot{y}\) is quadratic.
    When we look at the Kinetic Derivative \((\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{y}})\) vs. Time (s) graph though, we can see that the slope of this line \(\frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{y}}\)) is equal to the \(-\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\) value on the left graph. 
    Thus, we can derive the connection that \(-\frac{\partial U}{\partial y} = \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{y}})\).

<label for="show-more" id="text" style="line-height: 2">
    But how does this connect with what we know from classical mechanics? We can actually mathematically prove the equivalence between the Euler-Lagrange equation and Newton's 2nd Law!
</label>
<br><br>
<button id="show-more">Show Proof</button>
<br><br>
<span id="answer3" style="display: none; line-height: 1.8">
    We know from the Euler-Lagrange equation that \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{y}})\). We additionally know that \(L = T-U\), and that \(T = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{y}^2\), \(U = mgy\) for this situation.
    <br><br>
    \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial y} = F_y\) by definition.
    <br><br>
    \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{y}} = \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{y}} = m\dot{y} \implies \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{y}}) = m\ddot{y} = F_y\) by definition.
    <br><br>
    Note that \(-\frac{\partial U}{\partial y} = \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{y}})\) as seen in the graphs.
    <br><br>
    So, using the Euler-Lagrange equation, we can prove Newton's 2nd Law, \(F=ma\).
